This python code will take the list of top 100 most popular songs from billoard https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100 using web-scraping.
Then using spotify api and spotipy (spotify api for python)  (which was painful to read) creates a playlist of those songs.
Link to my created playlist :D https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4OTrLwADN0BrqShQLHS0U4?si=42442205da174ad2
